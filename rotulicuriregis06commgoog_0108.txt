Ralph de Dicet0‚ a most trusty and ac·
curate testimony, was not acquainted with
the history of the treasure‚ and commemo-
rates Peter Bas-il — and not Bertram de
Gurdun—-as the soldier by whose arrow
Richard was stricken. And the chronicle of
Dunstaple, the Annals ofMargan, Matthew
Paris (or rather Roger Wendover), and
Walsingham, relating the story of the trea-
sure, all designate the same Peter Bas-il as
the' youth by whom the quarrell was dis-
charged.

The manuscript chronic-le of Winchester
agrees with the last preceding authorities
in naming Peter Basil as the man, but
differs from them by ascribing to this indi-
vidual the unhappy fate of Bertram de Gur-
dun, and yet with a variation. Marcadeus
surrendered the prisoner to Richard’s sister
J oan, Countess of St.Giles, and she, and-
ποί MarcadeuS, plucked out his eyes), and
caused him to suffer other horrible mutilae--
tions and tortures, under which he expired.

The anonymous continuator of Geoffry,
the Prior of VigeoiS, a Limoisin Monastery,
places two knights, Peter Bru (perhaps
Brun) and Peter Basil, in the tower from
whence the missile proceeded: and adds,
that as it was reported, —a report which
he repeats without positively adopting it,—
Peter-,Basa was the marksman.
