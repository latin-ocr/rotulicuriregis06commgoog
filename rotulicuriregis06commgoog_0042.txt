xviii IN TRoDUCTloN.

In the archives of Guildhall‚ a single lim
commemorates the execution of the traitor
The vernacular Chronicle of the City informs
u8‚ how the ‘⁶ heretyke called with th«
Longe bord was drawen and hanged fo]
heresye and cursed doctryne that he ha<
taughte.’' A confession, said to have beer
made by him, acknowledging in his nam«
the foulest crimeS‚ was loudly and indus·
triously repeated and reported to th«
disgraoe and contumely of his adherents
They heeded not these accusations. The}
who had abandoned their advocate whet
living, lamented and honoured him whe1
dead. It was believed that miracles wer«
worked by the relies of this martyr t«
the popular cause. Hubert the J usticia
was able to chase away the votaries of Fit
Osbert, and to reduce the citizens to obe
dience z but the trespass which Hubert th
Archbishop had committed against th
privileges of the sanctuary, was not sorgoi
ten, and ultimately occasioned the losst
the great secular office which he held.
