xviii IN TRODUCTION.

In the archives of Guildhall, a single line.
commemorates the execution of the traitor.
The vernacular Chronicle of the city informs
u8‚ how the ‘⁶ heretyke called with the
Longe bord was drawen and lianged sor
heresye and cursed doctryne that he had
taughte.'' A confession, said to have been
made by him, acknowledging in his name
the foulest crimeS‚ was loudly and indus-
triously repeated and reported to the
disgraoc and contumely of his adherentS.
They heeded not these accusationS. They
who had abandoned their advocate when
living, lamented and honoured him when
dead. It was believed that miracles were
worked by the relics of this martyr to
the popular cause. Hubert the Justiciar
was able to chase away the votaries of Fitz
Osbert, and to reduce the citizens to obe-
dience z but the trespass which Hubert the
Archbishop had committed against the
privileges of the sanctuary, was not sorgot-
ten, and ultimately occasioned the loss of (ς xxxxxx )
the great secular office which he held.
