INTRODUCTION. xcix

‘⁶ cerely desire, that by all my endeavours
“ God may be glorified, the truth, divine

‘⁸ or human, vindicated, and the publick
“ benefited:

‘⁸ Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori.”

Such remarks are too instructive to be
omitted. They are the memorials of a
period when the individuals most distin-
guished by knowledge, hy learning, or by
intellectual eminence, were impressed with
the deep feeling of the duties resulting srom
the important station whereunto they had
been called. Raised up as teachers, freely
dispensing the gists freely bestowed upon
them, seeking neither present fame nor
worldly profit, but acting under an humble
responsibility for the faithful use of the
talenta entmsted to their stewardship. And
indeed, these sentimenta and principles
will alone enable the inquiret to proceed
steadily and cheerfussy, in labours, which
even humanly speaking, can never be
ripened into harvest, until the hand that
sowed the seed is mouldering in the grave.
Pursued with any other motives, the dreary
annals of literary history will warn him how
little chance he has os escaping stom the
most bitter vexation, sorrow, or despair.
