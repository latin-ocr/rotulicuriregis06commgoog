NOTES. cxiii

Pope was startled and scat-ed, and after expressing his surprise
to the Cardinals in somewhat unseemly language, he turned to
the Monk‚ and said, “ Brother, by St. Peter you shall not wait
for my death, your petition is granted ;” and before Pope Inno-
oent again tasted food, he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was authorized to restore the Monastery.

Now as this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bull,
which is preserved textually and entire, we must either admit
that the document is a forgery — and, at this period‚ the practice
of fabricating spurious Bulls prevailed exceedingly — or that
Matthew Paris, the Monk of St. Albam, was singularly
deceived.

1t is probable that Hubert was the ward os Glanville. He thus
expresses himself on the Foundation Charter of West Dereham.—
Omnibus Sanctae Matris Ecclesioe filiis, praesentibus et futuris,
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboracensis ecclesiae Decanus, oeternam in
Domino salutem. Sapientis est hiis, quae salute animae proficiunt,
dum potest, intendere et transitoriis oeterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes„ . . . quoddam coenobium Praemonstratensis
Ordinis m feudo nostro, apud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
animae meae, et patris et matris meae, et Domini Ranulphi de
Glanvffld et Bertae uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt. (Monasticon,
vol. vi. 899.) —Geoffry Fitz Peter is one os the attesting wit-
neoees to the Charter.

Dioeto, osa—The good Bishop was thus licensed by three
consecutive Metropolitans, the Venerable Anselm‚ Ralph, and
william de Corboyl. It therefore appears that he did not con-
sider that the sanction given by the Archbishop sor the time
being, bound his suceessors.
