English historians, were found. The very
valuable chronicle of this Cistertian

the arrow head, the passers-by, proceeding

with an “ Heaven speed you.’'—-Taking
these greetings as an omen, he engraved
a cross upon the metal: and with the

weapon, thus marked for a special purpose,
was Richard slain.
