NOTES. cxiii

Pope was startled and scared, and after expressing his surprize
to the Cardinals in somewhat unseemly language, he turned to
the Monk‚ and said, “ Brother, by St. Peter you shall not wait
for my death, your petition is granted ;'’ and before Pope Inno-
eent again tasted food, he issued the Bull by which Archbishop
Hubert was authorized to restore the Monastery.

Now as this statement is wholly inconsistent with the Bu11‚
which is preserved textually and entire, we must either admit
that the document is a forgery — and, at this period‚ the practice
of fabricating spurious Bulls prevailed exceedingly — or that
Matthew Paris, the Monk of St. Albam, was singularly
deceived.

lt is probable that Hubert was the ward of Glanville. He thus
expresses himself on the Foundation Charter of West Dereham.-
Omnibus Sanctae Matris Ecclesioe filiis, praesentibus et futuris}
Hubertus Dei gratia, Eboraoensis ecclesiae Decanus, oeternam in
Domino salutem. Sapientis est hiis, quae salute animoe proficiunt,
dum potest, intendere et transitoriis aeterna commutare. Quod
quidem intelligentes ..... quoddam eoenobium Praemonstmtensis
Ordinis in feudo nostr0‚ apud Derham fundavimus, pro salute
animm meae, et patris et matris meze, et Domini Ranulphi de
Glanm'lld et Bertoe uxoris ejus qui nos nutrierunt. (Monasticom
vol. vi. 899.) —Geoffry Fitz Peter is one of the attesting wit-
nesses to the Charter.

Dioeto, 652.—The good Bishop was thus licensed by three·
consecutive Metropolitans, the Venerable Anselm, Ralph, and
william de Corboyl. It therefore appears that he did not con-
sider that the sanction given by the Archbishop for the time:
being, bound his successors.
