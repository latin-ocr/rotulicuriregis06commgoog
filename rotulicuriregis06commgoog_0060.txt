xxxvi INTRODUCTION.·

Trenchemer‚ Richard's Sea Admiral, indi-
cates his profession and his skill.

With respect to the condition of the
common people, there are some slight yet
clear indicationS, that they were not stinted
in their means. Clean sheets were reason-
ably expected in the cottage of the churl;
and the ale-house keeper and the vintner
invited the guest in the upland towns.

All the lands of Roger de Mortimer in
the County of Norfolk, are seized into the
King's hands because he had tourneyed
without the King's licence. But Mortimer
finds pledges· that, before the feast of St.
Hilary,he will make his peace, or compound
with the King. His pledges are Roget
Earl Bigod‚ Galfridus de Say, and William
de Warenna3 and the Sheriff is thereupon
commanded to let him have his lands again.
Tournaments had been strictly prohibited
by three general CounciIS, but Richard
found it convenient and practicable to
raise money by granting dispensations
sor violating the precepts of the Church :—
one of the numerous proofs that the autho-
rity of the Clergy went for nothing, when-
ever the governing powers chose to com-

bine with the multitude in setting thei]
doctrines at defiance.

A day is given to Master Radulphu
’ Niger to answer concerning a prebend‚ i]
