acclamations of the multitude ; ‘⁶ He shall
‘⁴ no longer domineer over uS,” exclaimed
they. And—‘⁶ having held our Council be·-
“ fore all the people of the City, and in the
“ presence and with the approbation of the
‘⁴ J usticiar8,”—-it was decreed by John the
King’s brother, and by all the Bishops,
Earls, Barons, and by the Citizens of
London, that the chief J usticiar should
be deposed from the government of the
Kingdom. Earl John was then proclaimed
“ Summus Rector totius Regni.’' This
appointment was in no wise contemplated
by King Richard's patents or commissions;
and John, in the exercise of his authority,
appointed the Archbishop of Rouen as
Chief Justiciar under him, in conformity,
though not in obedience, to the King's
supposed commands.

Four Bishops and four Earls were de-
puted to convey the unwelcome intelligence
to the Justiciar. He fainted on receiving
the news, and dropped senseless on the
floor.

The part taken by the Citizens of Lon-
don in this transaction is very remarkable.
